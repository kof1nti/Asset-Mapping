# Asset-Mapping


Asset Mapping Project for ECG, Joeamah Geomatic Consult-2017
A study conducted by Africa Centre for Energy Policy (ACEP) indicates that ECG suffers huge losses due to illegal power connections and meter tampering. To remedy this, ECG asset Mapping was introduced to map all ECG assets using surveying and mapping techniques. As part of the asset mapping projects, these activities were carried out successfully.
•	Capturing of field data of all ECG assets including meters, poles, pylons, transformers, customers location using Trimble GPS in Tema and its environs.
•	Digitizing all mapped assets in Google Earth.
•	Categorizing assets using AutoCAD.
•	Editing asset data in ArcGIS and providing statistics and detailed information on all available ECG assets using advanced spatial analysis.
This project has been instrumental in ensuring that about GH₵ 6 million owed the ECG in 2021 were recovered as a result of illegal connections. It has also provided a means of tracking all ECG assets connected to the national grid without ECG’s knowledge. Ultimately a geospatial solution provided by Joeamah Geomatic Consult has improved revenue generation for the Electricity Company of Ghana.
